# Castle-Defense-Game
Castle defense game for 1 player versus computer opponents or 2 players against each other through multiplayer.
The frontend is made in AngularJS using primarily Typescript, while the backend is made in .Net CORE.

Each player starts with a castle and a set amount of income. Players choose to spend money to increase their income, or to buy units to defend their castle and attack the opposing castle.

There are currently 8 playable teams each with 8 unique units. There is also a rudimentary damage type system enabling some units to be more or less effective against others.

I have hosted the game on AWS in the past, but I have taken it down while I find a new free way to host it.
I am planning to expand and streamline the game in the future. I would like to set up a database and track match data to train actual AI to play against. There are also many adjustments to be made to make the game more robust and to flesh out the current systems.
